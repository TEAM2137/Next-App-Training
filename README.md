# Next-App-Training
Training Repository for using Next.js to create our new Scouting applicaiton.

<h2>Programmer Prep Videos</h2>
<p>Here is a starting point video to watch a developer creating an app with Nextjs that illustrates the major components of developing our scouting web application: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myYlGLFxZas&t=0s">LamaDev School Management App Part 1</a>. Note that we wont use every piece of this but it illustrates the major concepts pretty good.</p>
<p>Here is part 2 that illustrates connecting to a database. We will be using Prisma to connect to a MySQL data base: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sfiAyKy8Jo&t=0s">LamaDev School Management App Part 2</a>. Pay most attention here to using Prisma to connect to the data but we will not be using the same hosting.</p>
<p>Here is another tutorial from him deisgining a full stack social media site: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o080tU3sd0k">LamaSocial using Nextjs 15</a>. Note that unlike the prior examples, this one usees Nextjs 15 beta which is now general release. Also note that in this one he uses Hostinger to host the database and the app. We will be doing the same and I have already created an account for us to launch it on.</p>
<h2>Our Major App Components</h2>
<p>Here are the major components for our app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hosting: <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/vps-hosting">Hostinger.com</a></li>
  <li>Application Framework: <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs">Nextjs</a> (which utilizes <a href="https://react.dev/">Reactjs</a> for the client side application and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindsCSS</a> for design and styling of the app.</li>

  <li>Data Interaction: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/orm">Prisma ORM (opensource version)</a></li>
  <li>Database: <a href="https://mariadb.com/products/community-server/">MySQL (actually now MariaDB is what most hosting providers use and call MySQL)</a> working on switchnig to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> for our app development.</li>
  <li>Authentication: <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT (JSON Web Tokens, not utilized in the demos above)</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>General Reference</h2>
<p>Not sure where most of you are starting from. Here are some more general tutorials for the basics. If you don't know javascript but have worked with another language like python you should be able to pick it up pretty quickly. I put forward the tutorials above because they show most of what you will be doing and you can pick up Javascript, CSS, and HTML along the way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery">Javascript Mastery</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LamaDev">LamaDev</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja">Net Ninja</a> have lots of great tutroials on a variety of topics for Node.js based web-app development. We can also discuss along the way why I have picked the technologies in the list above.</p>
