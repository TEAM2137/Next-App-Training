This was a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and then edited to provide a simple start for designing an app.

## Getting Started

Download this folder and open with VS Code. Make sure you have Node.js installed to be able to run application dev server. Also, adding the extension 'Tailwind CSS IntelliSense' to VCS Code is very helpful for providing guides for inserting css styling to design your UI.

First, install the dependincies for this project by opening the terminal in VS Code and running:

```bash
npm -install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
